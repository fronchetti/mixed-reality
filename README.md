In our coursework, you will be asked to develop a simple yet appealing application in Mixed Reality.
Putting hands-on code is usually what developers expect as a first step, but coding skills are not enough for applications in the three-dimensional space.

The creative process behind applications in mixed reality usually starts with a draft of the experience you want to deliver with your work.
To formalize such experience, multiple strategies can help you prototype your idea, including techniques such as storyboarding and bodystorming.
Prototypes are not only used to sell your idea to the world but also to comprehend their possible limitations.
