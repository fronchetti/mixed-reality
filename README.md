# Introduction to Mixed Reality

## Task 1: Design process - Storyboards, bodystorming, and more...
In our coursework, you will be asked to develop a simple yet appealing application in Mixed Reality.
Putting hands-on code is usually what developers expect as a first step, but coding skills are not enough for applications in the three-dimensional space.

The creative process behind applications in mixed reality usually starts with a formal representation of the experience you want to deliver in your work.
To formalize such experience, multiple strategies can help you delineate your ideas, including techniques such as _storyboarding_ and _bodystorming_.
These representations are not only useful to sell your ideas to the world but also to establish requirements for your software and comprehend its limitations.

### Step 1: Familiarize yourself with design concepts in mixed reality:
Start by exploring the following articles:

- [**Thinking differently for Mixed Reality**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/discover/case-study-expanding-the-design-process-for-mixed-reality)
- [**UX elements overview**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/app-patterns-landingpage)
- [**Interaction models**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/interaction-fundamentals)

### Step 2: Put your creativity to work!
Now that you know how ideas are formalized in a mixed-reality environment, it is time to exercise your creativity. In collaboration with your group, 
define a simple application in mixed reality you would like to implement. Define what features of the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) you will use,
and what will be the use cases for your application. Choose a technique such as storyboarding and bodystorming to 
represent your ideas, and create illustrations for each use case scenario.

- If your group decided to use storyboarding, feel free to use any software tools you are comfortable with. If you don't have any tools in mind, maybe [**Figma**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/figma-toolkit) will be the best for you.
  If you prefer to do illustrations on paper, take pictures of each use case scenario at the end.
- If your group decided to do bodystorming, take pictures of each use case scenario to register your work.
  
Each use case must include the system, an actor, and a textual description of the scenario. If you are not familiar with how use cases are written, please check out this [**blog post**](https://www.wrike.com/blog/what-is-a-use-case/).

### Step 3: Upload your illustrations to Canvas!
To get the maximum number of points for this task, make sure your work fits the following requirements:
- [ ] My work is based on the features available in the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). If you are unsure about this requirement, make sure that the features you are planning to use are also described on the [**MRTK website**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/design/design).
- [ ] My work contains three figures, each representing a different use case.
- [ ] Each figure includes the system (i.e., application), an actor (i.e., user), and a textual description of the scenario.
